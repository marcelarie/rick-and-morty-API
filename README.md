### Rick and Morty API

You must create a website capable of displaying all the information in the series
(episodes, characters, locations) in an orderly manner so that you can navigate
through the episodes and characters.

The main objective is to show the Rick and Morty episodes and navigate through 
the information it provides us.

The information that you should obtain from the API of each section is as 
follows:

## EPISODES
ðŸ ² Information about the chapters of R&M:
- [ ] Name
- [ ] Air date
- [ ] Episode code (ex: S01E01)

## CHARACTERS
ðŸ ² Information about the characters of R&M:
- [ ] Name
- [ ] Status
- [ ] Species
- [ ] Gender
- [ ] Image
- [ ] Origin name (ex: Earth C-137):
    - With a button with detailed info about the origin location in the main
    - [ ] Location name, type and dimension
    - [ ] Resident list
- [ ] Episodes where the character appears ( episode name + code )


## LOCATIONS
ðŸ ² Information about the locations of R&M:
- [ ] Name
- [ ] Type
- [ ] Dimension

## WEB STRUCTURE
- [ ] Header with project title
- [ ] Sidebar with: List of episodes + button to load next page of episodes
- [ ] Main container

### IDEAS
